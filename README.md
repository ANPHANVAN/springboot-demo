# Spring Boot Demo – Java Backend Fundamentals

## Overview

This project is a backend prototype built with Java and Spring Boot to demonstrate fundamental backend development
concepts including:

- RESTful API design
- Layered architecture (Controller – Service – Repository)
- Dependency Injection (IoC)
- Exception handling
- Database interaction (if configured)
- Maven-based project configuration

The purpose of this project is to practice and strengthen core backend skills in a structured and maintainable way.
